*Project: Taxi order forecasting*

The taxi company accumulated historical data about number of taxi orders at airports. They want to get a forecast about number of orders for every next hour with a purpose to attract more cars in time of maximal load. We have to build ML model for such predictions. The level of RMSE on test data must be less than 48.
