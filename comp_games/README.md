Project: analysis of factors influencing the success of computer games

Project goal: to identify factors that determine the success of games, identify potentially successful products, and based on the data obtained, plan an advertising campaign for the next year

As part of the project, after the necessary preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, 2 statistical hypotheses were tested:

Hypothesis 1: The average user's ratings of the two platforms are the same. Test result: The null hypothesis could not be rejected; there is reason to assert that the average user's ratings for the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same.

Hypothesis 2. Average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different. Test result: The null hypothesis about the equality of average ratings for games in the Action and Sports genres was rejected; there is reason to assert that the average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are not equal.

Recommendations are given to businesses: when planning an advertising campaign for an online store, it is most reasonable to focus on the PS4 platform, as the most popular in Europe and other countries, XOne, as very popular in North America, and 3DS as the most popular in Japan. Among the genres, it is worth paying attention to Shooter, Action, Sports, Role-Playing.
