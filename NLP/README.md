According to the goal of the project - to get the model to identify toxic comments on the store's website, the necessary libraries and dataset were downloaded, and an initial assessment of the data was carried out.

We used the language model pretrained on toxic comments to have as good result as possible.

Predictions of model were considered as toxic by score level more then 0.5; the F1 metric was 90.9%.

Thus, pretrained language models show very good performance and can be used to select toxic comments.
